# IT Support Ticketing Simulation

Hands-on practice with **IT Support Ticketing** using the Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk platform.  
Simulated real-world IT workflows: logging issues, prioritising tickets, documenting troubleshooting, and closing tickets with user communication.

---

## Ticket Handling Workflow
- Users raise tickets (e.g. password reset, VPN not connecting).  
- Tickets are prioritised (High, Medium, Low).  
- Internal notes are added for technical troubleshooting.  
- Public responses are shared with users.  
- Statuses updated (Open → Waiting → Closed).
