# IT-support-ticketing-simulation
This project demonstrates my hands-on practice with IT Support Ticketing using the Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk platform.   The goal was to simulate real-world IT support workflows: logging issues, prioritising tickets, documenting troubleshooting, and closing tickets with user communication.
